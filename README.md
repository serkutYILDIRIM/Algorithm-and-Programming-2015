# Algorithm-and-Programming-2015
Small algorithm projects I did when I was in the 1st grade at school in 2015.In the first semester of the first year, we used the C++ programming language in algorithm and programming lessons at school.I collected the algorithm assignments I did during the 0.5 semester education period in 2015 in a file and I still keep them to dont forgot those hard days since 2015 :) Hard days because, when i started the school, i did not know anything about algorithm and progrogramming languages but i always interested in computer science and i always believed will be succesfully person in this area.
